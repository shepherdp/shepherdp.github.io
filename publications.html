                <p><b>Abstract: </b>The study of opinion dynamics has experienced a gain in interest recently, especially with
                individual communication infrastructures like the Internet. Much of this research uses simulations with
                agents whose behavior and preferences are governed by a small set of rules. Most agent models in the
                literature are homophilic and/or conforming. In this work, we explore the opinion trajectory and
                self-sorting tendencies of a relatively new agent type: mesophilic agents, or those whose preference is for
                an even mix of similarity and difference of opinion with each neighbor. We characterize the behavior of
                these agents in topologically dynamic networks, and examine long-term behaviors of networks via common
                metrics as well as the reward function used to reflect agent preferences. We empirically uncover several
                apparent natural boundaries on things like network density and average.

        <p><b>Abstract: </b>In an increasingly digitally interconnected world, the study of social networks and their
            dynamics is burgeoning. Anthropologically, the ubiquity of online social networks has had striking
            implications for the condition of large portions of humanity.  This technology has facilitated content
            creation of virtually all sorts, information sharing on an unprecedented scale, and connections and
            communities among people with similar interests and skills. The first part of my research is a social
            network evolution and visualization engine. Built on top of existing technologies, my software is designed
            to provide abstractions from the underlying libraries, drive real-time network evolution based on
            user-defined parameters, and optionally visualize that evolution at each step of the process. My software
            provides a low maintenance interface for the creation of networks and update schemes for a wide array of
            experimental contexts, an engine to drive network evolution, and a visualization platform to provide
            real-time feedback about different aspects of the network to the researcher, as well as fine-grained
            debugging tools.  We conducted investigations into the opinion dynamics of networks when multiple agent
            “archetypes” interact together with this platform. We modeled agents’ archetypes with respect to two
            attributes: their preference over their friends’ opinion profiles, and their tendency to change their
            opinion over time. We extended the current state of agent modeling in opinion diffusion by providing a
            unified 2D trajectory/preference space for agents that incorporates most common models in the literature.
            We investigated six agent archetypes from this space, and examined the behavior of the network as a whole
            and the individual agents in a variety of contexts. In another branch of work using our software, we
            developed a network of agents who must carry out both economic and social activities during a pandemic.
            Agents’ decisions about what actions to take (self-protective measures like masking, social distancing, or
            waiting to run errands) are based on several factors, including perception of risk (obtained from news
            reports, social connections, etc.) and economic need. We show with preliminary testing that this platform is
            able to execute standard pandemic models successfully with the incorporation of the economic and social
            dimensions, and that this paradigm may provide useful insight into effective agent-level response policies
            that can be used in concert with other top-down approaches that comprise most of the recent pandemic
            response research. We have investigated the implications of varying behavior profiles within a network of
            agents, and how those behavioral compositions affect the overall climate of the network in return, and this
            software will continue to facilitate similar research into the future.

        <p><b>Abstract: </b>We present a network software suite that can model contagions or opinion manipulation in
            social networks, that combines features from the standard packages and extends them to allow complex,
            interacting, dynamic topologies, and dynamic heterogeneous agent types, with individual interaction
            policies. The framework allows for the easy implementation of new agent types, and provides flexible
            visualization tools to elucidate network behavior over time.

                <p><b>Abstract: </b>As research into the dynamics and properties of opinion diffusion on social networks has
                    increased, so too has the attention paid to modeling such systems. Simulations using agent-based modeling
                    (ABM) analyze aggregate network outcomes when individual agents act on typically limited information, and
                    tend to focus on agents that are conforming and homophilic - that is, they prefer to be around similar
                    others, and they update their own personal state over time to be more like their friends. In this work, we
                    illustrate the value of diverse agent modeling in environments that allow for strategic unfriending. We
                    focus on network dynamics generated by three agent models, or archetypes. Our work shows that polarization
                    and consensus dynamics, as well as topological clustering effects, may rely more than previously known on
                    the interplay between individuals' goals for the composition of their neighborhood's opinions.</p>
