        <p>Over the summer of 2023, I led a team of three students in building a web interface for a tool I had been
        using in class.  Here's the use case:</p>
        <p>Imagine you are in charge of training a group of 20 people in a set of software tools.  This training will
        take several weeks, so you want to keep the participants engaged and excited with their work, rather than
        dipping into training tedium.  You have decided that a great way to train your participants is to create
        exploratory exercises in which you teach them a part of the software, and then ask them to solve some problems
        designed to highlight that functionality.  To encourage collaborative problem-solving and team responsibility,
        you split your participants into five groups of four people each.  You throw the names into a hat and draw
        them out four at a time, and you have your groups.  Wonderful!</p>
        <p>Two days of activities go by, and you realize that keeping everyone working with the same set of partners
        for weeks on end will hurt your goal of fostering the ability to collaborate with a wide range of people, so you
        decide to start changing groups each day.  You draw names out of a hat again and make groups, only to realize
        that several people are now in groups with some of the people they have already worked with.  You do the hat
        thing again, and realize that this method just isn't good enough.  You write all the names down on a piece of
        paper, along with previous group assignments, and laboriously find a new matching of participants such that
        everone is now in groups with <em>only</em> new partners.  Wonderful!</p>
        <p>A week goes by, and you realize that re-grouping people in this way is too mentally taxing on the one hand,
        and insufficient on the other.  After three or four re-groupings, there is no possibility of everyone working
        with new partners, so you have to find a way to <em>maximize</em> the number of new partners, understanding that
        the number of possible new partnerships goes down with each new group assignment.  Additionally, there have been
        one or two personal conflicts between partners, and you know you need to not group them together in the future.
        ADDITIONALLY additionally, some participants are taking to the material much more quickly than others, and you
        notice that when a group is made that only contains members that need more help, the experience is worse and
        less productive for all of them.  If only there were, say, a web platform one could use to assign a group of
        people to different teams over and over again according to constraints like these...</p>

        <p>Over the course of two months, my students successfully came together to accomplish an amazing taks:
        building and deploying the tool described above.  TeamMaker is an online platform that allows educators,
        corporate trainers, etc. to upload a list of participants, and then repeatedly group them into teams based on
        the criteria laid out by the user.  Tojo was the web engineer, showing off his skills in web development to
        build the user interface and authentication framework.  Silas was our algorithms expert who designed three
        different placement algorithms depending on your needs.  Zaki was our data master, designing and incorporating
        database functionality into the website to allow for anyone to make an account and store as many different
        classes of participants as they like.  Together, my team showed enormous ingenuity and created a product that
        can be used in a diverse array of contexts, from schools to the training room.</p>
