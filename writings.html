      <h3 style="color: green"><b>The 2/3 Problem</b></h3>
      <p>I put an article out on Medium that I hope to continually update.  It describes a phenomenon I've seen many
        examples of in several different places.  The essence of the 2/3 Problem is this: some problems exist that are
        really easy to solve when <em>n</em> = 2, but they become VERY hard to solve when <em>n</em> = 3, whatever
        <em>n</em> happens to be in the case at hand.  Three notable examples are the Three Body Problem out of physics,
        3-SAT out of computer science, and Fermat's Last Theorem from mathematics.
      </p>

      <p>All three of these problems are parameterized by a number <em>n</em> - for the first, it is the number of
        bodies; for the second, it is the number of variables per clause; and for the third, it is the value of the
        exponent.  In all three cases, if you set <em>n</em> = 2 in their respective contexts, these three problems are
        incredibly easy to solve.  As soon as <em>n</em> = 3, they become incredibly difficult (or impossible) to solve.
      </p>

      <p>Please take a minute to read through my <a href="https://medium.com/@patrick.shepherd.cs/the-2-3-problem-bede569a9aa1">
          article</a> here and learn about a few of these problems.  Who knows?  Maybe you know of your own 2/3 Problem!
        I would love to hear about it.

      <h3 style="color: green"><b>Simple Machine Learning: Teaching a Computer to Spot Random Strings</b></h3>
      <p>A short while ago, I was working on a project for a company that involved some general web scraping. In essence,
        I would go through a few public databases and collect information about companies that had been users of
        various financial instruments.  I would then scour the web for each of these companies to gather other public
        information about them - mostly things like business addresses and company websites.  In order to keep my
        searches broad so as not to miss any juicy data, I had to gather a lot of raw data that turned out to be
        garbage and needed to be gone through and cleaned out.
      </p>
      <p>The nature of this "garbage" was generally strings representing URLs that turned out to just be random character
        strings I had picked up off of some website during the search.  I would have plenty of strings like "aHH6tgI.com"
        in my data set, and needed to be rid of them because they were cluttering up my data space.  On the one hand,
        I did NOT want to filter these things manually.  On the other hand, I also didn't want to narrow my tool's
        search capabilities because it was gathering the data I needed it to.
      </p>
      <p>In response to this, I created a miniature machine learning model, trained it on valid strings, and then allowed
        it to do my data cleansing for me.  I ran several tests against data I had labeled to measure its performance,
        and it was able to clean up far over 95% of the "garbage" in my data, and lost less than 1% of the good data.
        Frankly, even the cases in which good data was filtered out were understandable, given the individual strings
        that didn't make it through the filter.
      </p>

      <p>To see a small example of data science and ML in action, feel free to take a look through the
        <a href="https://medium.com/@patrick.shepherd.cs/the-2-3-problem-bede569a9aa1">
          article</a> here.  It may inspire you to pick up a little machine learning yourself!  It's much more approachable
        than people give it credit for.
